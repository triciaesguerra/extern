### BSD vs POSIX
__Berkeley Sockets__ . Sockets uses the BSD interface that was developed by BBN for the TCP/IP protocol suite under DARPA contract on 4.1aBSD and released in 4.2BSD. BSD Sockets provides a set of primary API functions that are typically implemented as system calls. The BSD Sockets interface is non-standard, operated diï¬€erently from the POSIX interface in subtle ways, and is now deprecated in favour of the POSIX/SUS standard Sockets interface.

__POSIX Sockets__ . Sockets were standardized by X/Open, later the OpenGroup, and IEEE in the POSIX standardization process. They appear in XNS 5.2 [XNS99], SUSv1 [SUS95], SUSv2 [SUS98] and SUSv3 [SUS03]. POSIX/SUS Sockets is now the common application environment for accessing networking, deprecating the XTI for TCP/IP networking applications.
